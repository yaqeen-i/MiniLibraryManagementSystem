# MiniLibraryManagementSystem

This Project is intended to give me a slight expertise in JavaEE using Java Servlets, JavaServer Pages. This project is a Library management system with Role-Based Access (Admin, Librarian and Patron). 

An Admin oversees the system, Admin can see, edit, delete both books or users information.

A Librarian Manages Patron's Data in the system as well as books Data, A Librarian can also return a book based on synchronized transactionID generated for the patron and used by Librarian to retrun the book.

A Patron can search for books, borrow books and add a review for a book.
